# boiler

boiler helps you to create client or server side project with one command. it simply leverages npx. there is also a fullstack option that gets generated with a docker-compose file and nginx out of the box.

ðŸ¤˜this is probably useless, but it was really fun to build

<!-- two options -->

```
$ npx boiler create
```

```
$ npm i -g boiler
$ boiler create
```
